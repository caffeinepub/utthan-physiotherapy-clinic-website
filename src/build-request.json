      "id": "REQ-54",
      "text": "Update the site header to use the uploaded `logo.svg` asset and ensure it renders in the primary brand color (#2E0527) on both desktop and mobile. The logo must render as an actual image/graphic (not alt text) and should not rely on inline `style={{ color: ... }}` on an `<img>` tag (since that does not theme most SVG images). Ensure the logo source path is consistent across the codebase (e.g., avoid mixing `/assets/logo.svg` and `/assets/images/logo.svg`) and that the rendered logo color follows `text-primary` / `currentColor` so it stays aligned with the theme.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On all breakpoints, the header logo renders visually (no alt-text-only rendering) and links to `/`.",
        "The header logo color is exactly the primary brand color (#2E0527) in normal/light mode.",
        "The solution uses a themeable approach (e.g., `currentColor` / `text-primary` or equivalent) rather than an inline `color` style on an `<img>` element.",
        "Only one canonical logo asset path is used by the header logo implementation, and it resolves without 404s in the deployed build."
