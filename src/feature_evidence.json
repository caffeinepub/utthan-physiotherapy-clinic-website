      "featureTitle": "Update the site header to use the uploaded `logo.svg` asset and ensure it renders in the primary brand color (#2E0527) on both desktop and mobile. The logo must render as an actual image/graphic (not alt text) and should not rely on inline `style={{ color: ... }}` on an `<img>` tag (since that does not theme most SVG images). Ensure the logo source path is consistent across the codebase (e.g., avoid mixing `/assets/logo.svg` and `/assets/images/logo.svg`) and that the rendered logo color follows `text-primary` / `currentColor` so it stays aligned with the theme.",
