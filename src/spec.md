# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update branding and key Home/Contact elements: use an SVG logo, swap the hero visual and refine headline styling, correct displayed Google rating, embed a responsive Google Map, and remove Facebook from social links.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the header’s text-only logo block with the provided SVG logo, ensuring responsive sizing and in-app color control to match the site palette.
- Fully replace the current Home hero image with a background-removed cutout version of the provided back_pain.png image and ensure it renders correctly across breakpoints.
- Adjust the Home hero headline typography to be less bold with increased letter spacing while maintaining readability/contrast, without impacting other headings site-wide.
- Update displayed aggregate rating everywhere it appears to “4.9” with “147” reviews, including the Home trust badge and the LocalBusiness JSON-LD aggregateRating.
- Add the provided Google Maps iframe embed to the Contact section/page and style it responsively to avoid horizontal scrolling on mobile.
- Remove the Facebook icon/link from the UI and delete/disable any Facebook entry from the shared clinic social links source so it cannot be rendered elsewhere.

**User-visible outcome:** The site shows the new SVG logo, a refreshed hero visual with improved headline readability, accurate Google rating/review count, an embedded map for directions on the Contact page, and no Facebook social icon/link anywhere.
