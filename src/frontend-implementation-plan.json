      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "On all breakpoints, the header logo renders visually (no alt-text-only rendering) and links to `/`.",
        "The header logo color is exactly the primary brand color (#2E0527) in normal/light mode.",
        "The solution uses a themeable approach (e.g., `currentColor` / `text-primary` or equivalent) rather than an inline `color` style on an `<img>` element.",
        "Only one canonical logo asset path is used by the header logo implementation, and it resolves without 404s in the deployed build."
