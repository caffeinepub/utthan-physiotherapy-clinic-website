  "summary": "REQ-54 appears implemented by introducing a themeable logo component (CSS mask using /assets/logo.svg with currentColor) and wiring it into the header link to '/'. The diff also includes broader brand palette changes in index.css that go beyond the header logo requirement.",

    {
      "description": "Broad update/replacement of the site-wide brand palette CSS variables (primary/secondary/accent/muted/background/etc. and dark mode variants), beyond what is strictly required to update the header logo to use logo.svg and render in the primary brand color.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest is narrowly scoped to updating the header logo behavior/color/path consistency; it does not request a full palette overhaul.",
