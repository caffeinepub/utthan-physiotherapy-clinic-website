  "summary": "REQ-2 is implemented by updating Pride Moments image srcs and alt text in frontend/src/content/prideMoments.ts. REQ-1 is not evidenced because no image files were added under static assets. REQ-3 is not evidenced because no carousel/navigation code changes are shown, only content data changes.",

      "reason": "Diff shows no added files (\"Added: 0\" and \"ADDED FILES: none\"), so there is no evidence the image assets were actually added to a static assets directory (e.g., frontend/public/assets/) and would be loadable without 404s.",

        "frontend/src/content/prideMoments.ts (only content updated; no carousel logic shown)",
