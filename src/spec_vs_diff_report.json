  "summary": "REQ-65 appears implemented: the mobile navigation panel no longer renders any logo, while the header still shows a clickable logo linking to Home. REQ-66 is not clearly satisfied because the logo color is applied via a CSS filter on an <img> (logo.svg), which does not guarantee an exact #70316c color in computed styles.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-66",
      "requirement": "Ensure the header logo is colored exactly #70316c everywhere it appears in the header (desktop header and mobile header top bar), using the same uploaded logo.svg asset.",
      "reason": "The diff applies a CSS `filter` (`.utthan-logo-brand`) to an `<img src=\"/assets/logo.svg\">`. Filters can visually approximate a target color but generally do not make the rendered graphic's color computably equal to an exact hex value (#70316c), and may vary by browser/rendering. No evidence of editing the SVG to use #70316c or using an inline SVG with `fill`/`stroke` set to #70316c.",
